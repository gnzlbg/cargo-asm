# cargo-asm

[![crates.io version][crate-shield]][crate] [![Travis build status][travis-shield]][travis] [![Appveyor build status][appveyor-shield]][appveyor] [![License][license-shield]][license]


> A [`cargo`] subcommand that displays the assembly or llvm-ir generated for Rust source code.

# Install

```
cargo install cargo-asm
```

# Example

To view the assembly of the function `double_n` in the module `bar` of the crate
[`lib_crate`] annotated with its corresponding Rust code, go to the crate's root
directory

```
git clone git@github.com:gnzlbg/cargo-asm.git
cd cargo-asm/cargo-asm-test/lib_crate
```

and type:

```
cargo asm lib_crate::bar::double_n --rust
```

which outputs:

(note: the source-code mapping information emitted by rustc after optimizations is
sometimes far from perfect, like in this case. Take it with a grain of salt.)


To view the LLVM IR type

```
cargo llvm-ir lib_crate::bar::double_n
```

#  Features

* Platform support:

  * OS: Linux, Windows, and MacOSX.
  * Rust: nightly and stable.
  * Architectures: x86, x86_64, arm, aarch64, powerpc, mips, sparc.

* Displaying:

  * Assembly in Intel or AT&T syntax.
  * Corresponding Rust source code alongside assembly.
  * JSON AST for further processing.
  * LLVM-IR.

* Querying:
  * list all the symbols that you can inspect

    ```
    cargo asm
    ```

  * functions, for example: `foo`:
    ```
    cargo asm crate::path::to::foo
    ```
  * inherent method, for example: `foo` of a type `Foo` (that is, `Foo::foo`):
    ```
    cargo asm crate::path::to::Foo::foo
    ```
  * trait method implementations, for example: `bar` of the trait `Bar` for the type `Foo`:
    ```
    cargo asm "<crate::path::to::Foo as crate::path::to::Bar>::bar"
    ```

  * generic functions, methods, ...

To search for a function named `foo` in some path, one can just type `cargo asm
foo`. The command will return a list of all similarly named functions
independently of the path.
